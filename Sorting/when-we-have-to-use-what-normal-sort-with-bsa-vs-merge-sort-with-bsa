when we have to apply binary search on array where array cannot be sorted ( elements order cannot be changed) then we have to apply merge sort instead of normal sort and top of that binary search will be applied .


✅ Use Normal Sort + Binary Search when:

You're dealing with static arrays or subarrays, and

You can precompute values (e.g. pairwise distances, prefix sums), and

You can sort those values and index/search in them

✅ Example problems:

719. K-th Smallest Pair Distance

K-th Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

Koko Eating Bananas

✅ Use Merge Sort (with counting logic) when:

You are dealing with subarrays, range queries, or prefix sums, and

You need to count how many ranges/pairs satisfy a condition (e.g., sum ≤ X), and

The array may contain negative numbers, which breaks two-pointer logic

✅ Example problems:

1918. K-th Smallest Subarray Sum (with negative numbers)

Count of Range Sum

Reverse Pairs
