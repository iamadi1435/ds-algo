1.For 2D grid with any values (0,1/positive value ) if the diection is not limited to two directions then we have to use dijikstra or 0-1 bfs to solve 
 shortest path problem of grid.
2. Dijikstra,0-1 Dfs,Bellman ford is available for both graphs and 2D matrix also.
3.BFS does not work for weighted graphs unless modified with a priority queue, which ultimately turns it into Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
4.DFS would be highly inefficient because it would explore all possible paths, many of which would be unnecessary since they do not guarantee the shortest travel time.
